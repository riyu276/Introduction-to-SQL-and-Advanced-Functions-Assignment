        "\n",
        "Answer : Purpose of SQL Constraints:\n",
        "SQL constraints are rules applied to table columns to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data stored in a database. They prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being entered.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. PRIMARY KEY Constraint\n",
        "* Purpose: Ensures each record in a table is uniquely identified.\n",
        "* Rules: The column(s) defined as a primary key must be unique and not null.\n",
        "* Scenario: In an employee database, each employee must have a unique ID — no two employees can share the same EmpID.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. FOREIGN KEY Constraint\n",
        "* Purpose: Maintains referential integrity between two tables by linking a column in one table to the primary key in another.\n",
        "* Scenario: Ensures that an order cannot exist for an employee who isn’t listed in the Employees table.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. CHECK Constraint\n",
        "* Purpose: Ensures that the values in a column meet a specific condition.\n",

        "has 10 records?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer : 1. LIMIT Clause\n",
        "* Purpose: Restricts the number of rows returned by a query.\n",
        "* Usage: LIMIT n returns only the first n rows from the result set.\n",
        "* Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "SELECT * FROM Students LIMIT 10;\n",
        "\n",
        "This retrieves the first 10 records from the Students table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. OFFSET Clause\n",
        "* Purpose: Skips a specified number of rows before starting to return records.\n",
        "* Usage: OFFSET n skips the first n rows and begins displaying results after that point.\n",
        "* Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "SELECT * FROM Students OFFSET 10;\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "OFFSET = (page_number - 1) * records_per_page\n",

        "SELECT * FROM Students\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* OFFSET 20 → skips the first 20 records.\n",
